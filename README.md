# rword

Say you've got a really cool project ready, but you can't figure out what to name it. This script can help. It generates names that fit a pattern. For example, maybe you're creating you're own linux distro, and you want a 6 letter name, with the last two letters OS. Simply running ```rword.py "1001OS"``` gives ideas like ```cairOS``` and ```buenOS```!

# Template syntax

```
*: any letter
1: any consonant
0: any vowel
all other letters remain same
```
